Further helpful information on **ggplot2** can be found at:

- the [R Graphics cook book](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
- a [tutorial by the Harvad University](http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/Rgraphics.html#introduction)
- this [page by Zev Ross](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/)

Definitively worth a look is also this platform of [**ggplot** extensions](http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/).
