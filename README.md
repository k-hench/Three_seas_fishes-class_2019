This folder contains a small selection of R stuff:

-   how to plot **boxplots with significance codes**
    using **ggplot2**
-   how to create a **map including piecharts**
-   how to do an **NMDS** plot and run a
    **PERMANOVA**

To look at the **R** scripts go use [this link](https://k-hench.github.io/Three_seas_fishes-class_2019/index.html).

Further helpful information on **ggplot2** can be found at:

-   the [R Graphics cook book](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
-   a [tutorial by the Harvad
    University](http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/Rgraphics.html#introduction)
-   this [page by Zev
    Ross](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/)

Definitively worth a look is also this platform of [**ggplot**
extensions](http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Further **really** useful help on **R** is given by Hadley Wickham in his online book ["R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also take a look at [**Inkscape**](https://inkscape.org/en/), a cool program to polish your plots after exporting them from R.
This is especially useful for the map results as it can be used to separate overlapping pie-charts.

Pleas note that I can not redistribute the shapefile needed for the mapping script - you will need to download it individually from [gadm](http://www.gadm.org/country). Choose **Panama** as Country and **Shapefile** as file format.
